# âœ¨ Course Announcement âœ¨  

This course will take us on a journey through some of the most exciting recent advances in modern geometry, where **o-minimal geometry meets Hodge theory**. Building on the groundbreaking work of **Bakker, Brunebarbe, Klingler, and Tsimerman**, we will explore how tools from logic and real geometry can resolve long-standing problems in algebraic geometry.  

---

## ðŸŽ¯ Course Goals  
1. Understand the new proof of the **Cattaniâ€“Deligneâ€“Kaplan Theorem** on the algebraicity of Hodge loci.  
2. Learn how the long-standing **Griffiths Conjecture** on the quasi-projectivity of images of period maps was finally solved.

## ðŸ“š Course Outline  

### 1. Introduction to Hodge Theory  
Weâ€™ll begin with the fundamentals:  
- Hodge structures (pure and mixed)  
- Variations and degenerations  
- Schmidâ€™s celebrated \( SL_2 \)-orbit theorem  

---

### 2. O-minimal Geometry: Taming Infinity  
Here we enter the world of o-minimal structures, the key tool behind the breakthroughs. We will focus on two landmark results:  
- **Wilkieâ€™s Theorem**: semi-algebraic sets together with the graph of the exponential function form an o-minimal structure.  
- **Peterzilâ€“Starchenko Theorem**: complex analytic sets definable in an o-minimal structure are in fact algebraic.  

These results provide the essential bridge between real analytic definability and algebraic geometry.  

---

### 3. Breakthroughs in Hodge Theory  
Finally, we bring the strands together to understand the proofs of:  
- The algebraicity of Hodge loci.  
- Griffithsâ€™s Conjecture on the quasi-projectivity of period map images.
