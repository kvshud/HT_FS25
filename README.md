# Introduction

The aim of this course is to explore recent breakthroughs in the application of o-minimal geometry to Hodge theory, developed in the seminal works of Bakker, Brunebarbe, Klingler, and Tsimerman. Two central goals will guide our course:
	1.	To understand the new proof of the Cattani–Deligne–Kaplan Theorem on the algebraicity of Hodge loci.
	2.	To delve into the resolution of Griffiths’s long-standing conjecture on the quasi-projectivity of images of period maps.

The course will be structured in three parts:
	1.	**Foundations of Hodge Theory**
We begin with an introduction to Hodge theory, covering (mixed) Hodge structures, their variations and degenerations, and culminating in an account of Schmid’s SL_2-orbit theorem.
	2.	**O-minimal Geometry**
Next, we turn to the basics of o-minimal geometry, highlighting Wilkie’s striking result that the semi-algebraic sets, together with the graph of the exponential function, form an o-minimal structure. This perspective will serve as the key bridge to recent advances in Hodge theory.
	3.	**(Almost) a million dollars**
Finally, we will engage with the heart of the subject:
	•	The algebraicity of Hodge loci.
	•	Griffiths’s Conjecture on the quasi-projectivity of period map images.
